## **Networking Layers and Protocols**
Zephyr's networking stack follows the standard OSI model, with specific protocols handling different aspects of data communication.

---
## **The Layered Structure of Networking**
Think of networking like sending a letter:
1. **You write the letter** → **Application Layer** (Defines what data to send)
2. **You put it in an envelope** → **Transport Layer** (Ensures how the data is delivered)
3. **You write the recipient’s address** → **Network Layer** (Determines where the data goes)
4. **The post office delivers it** → **Data Link & Physical Layers** (Physically transfers the data)

Each protocol belongs to a specific layer and plays a role in data communication.

---
### **1. Application Layer (Handles user communication)**
The application layer provides communication services to end-users or devices.

| Protocol | Function | How It Helps in Communication |
|----------|----------|------------------------------|
| HTTP/HTTPS | Web communication | Enables web browsers and servers to exchange data |
| MQTT | IoT messaging over TCP | Allows IoT devices to communicate via lightweight messages |
| CoAP | Lightweight IoT communication over UDP | Enables constrained devices to exchange minimal data efficiently |

---
### **2. Transport Layer (Controls data delivery)**
This layer ensures the correct delivery of messages between devices.

| Protocol | Function | How It Helps in Communication |
|----------|----------|------------------------------|
| TCP | Reliable, ordered data transmission | Ensures all packets arrive intact and in order |
| UDP | Fast, connectionless transmission | Transmits data quickly without waiting for confirmation |

TCP ensures reliability by retransmitting lost packets, while UDP sacrifices reliability for speed.

---

This layer assigns addresses and routes packets between networks.

| Protocol | Function | How It Helps in Communication |
|----------|----------|------------------------------|
| IPv4 | 32-bit addressing for standard networking | Provides IP addresses and routes data over the internet |
| IPv6 | 128-bit addressing for future-proof networking | Supports a larger address space and more efficient routing |
| 6LoWPAN | Compressed IPv6 for low-power IoT networks | Optimizes IPv6 for low-power wireless communication |

IPv4 and IPv6 assign unique addresses to devices, while 6LoWPAN adapts IPv6 for energy-efficient communication in IoT.

---
### **4. Data Link Layer (Transfers data over different networks)**
This layer establishes direct connections between devices within the same network.

| Protocol | Function | How It Helps in Communication |
|----------|----------|------------------------------|
| Ethernet (802.3) | Wired communication | Transfers data via physical cables for reliability |
| Wi-Fi (802.11) | Wireless internet access | Enables wireless device connectivity |
| Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) | Short-range, low-power wireless communication | Optimizes wireless communication for minimal energy usage |
| IEEE 802.15.4 | Low-power wireless mesh networking | Supports IoT networks with multi-hop communication |

## **Understanding Network Headers**
Headers provide essential metadata for packet transmission. Each layer in the OSI model adds its own header:

| **Layer** | **Header Content** |
|-----------|------------------|
| Application Layer | Protocol-specific data (e.g., HTTP request type) |
| Transport Layer | Port numbers, checksum, sequence number (TCP/UDP headers) |
| Network Layer | Source & destination IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6 headers) |
| Data Link Layer | Source & destination MAC addresses (Ethernet/Wi-Fi headers) |
| Physical Layer | Signal encoding details |

### **Example: UDP Header Format**
| Field | Size (Bytes) | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Source Port | 2 | Identifies sending application |
| Destination Port | 2 | Identifies receiving application |
| Length | 2 | Total size of UDP segment |
| Checksum | 2 | Error detection value |

---

## **Connection & Routing Mechanisms**
| **Term** | **Function** |
|----------|-------------|
| **Router** | Directs packets between different networks |
| **Gateway** | Bridges different network types |
| **Subnet** | Divides large networks into smaller segments |
| **MAC Address** | Identifies devices within a local network |

When sending data, the **MAC address** helps within a local network, while the **IP address** ensures communication over the internet.

---

## **Conclusion**

Each protocol is chosen based on power, speed, and reliability requirements.

## **Data Transmission and Reception in Networking (RX & TX)**

### **Overview**
In networking, data transmission follows a structured path from the application to the physical medium and vice versa. This process is divided into two main operations:
- **TX (Transmit)** – Sending data from an application to the network.
- **RX (Receive)** – Receiving data from the network and delivering it to the application.

Each step involves various layers handling different aspects of data processing, queue management, and protocol handling.

---

## **Data Transmission (TX) – Sending Data**
### **1. Application Layer (User Data Submission)**
- The application initiates data transfer using the **BSD Socket API** (`send()`, `sendto()`).
- The data is copied into internal **network buffer (`net_buf`)** structures in kernel space.

### **2. Transport Layer (Adding Protocol Headers)**
- Based on the **socket type**, a **transport protocol header** is added:
  - **UDP Socket** → Adds a **UDP header** (connectionless, faster, no reliability checks).
  - **TCP Socket** → Adds a **TCP header** (reliable, ordered transmission with acknowledgments).

### **3. Network Layer (IP Header Processing - L3)**
- The **IP header** is added to the packet (either **IPv4** or **IPv6**).
- The **network stack** verifies that the network interface is correctly set up.

### **4. Data Queuing (Transmit Queue Processing - `k_fifo`)**
- The packet is classified and placed in a **transmit queue (`k_fifo`)** for priority handling.
- By default, there is **one TX queue**, but Zephyr supports up to **8 queues** for traffic classification.

### **5. Data Link Layer (L2 Header & Processing)**
- The **L2 module** performs:
  - Packet validation.
  - **L2 header creation** (e.g., Ethernet MAC header, Wi-Fi frames).

### **6. Device Driver & Physical Transmission**
- The **device driver** sends the packet out via the selected **network interface** (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, BLE, etc.).
- The data is transmitted over the physical medium.

---

## **Data Reception (RX) – Receiving Data**
### **1. Device Driver Captures Incoming Packet**
- The **network interface** (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, BLE, etc.) receives the packet from the physical medium.
- The **device driver** allocates **network buffers (`net_buf`)** to store incoming data.

### **2. Data Queuing (Receive Queue Processing - `k_fifo`)**
- The packet is placed into an **RX queue (`k_fifo`)** for processing.
- By default, there is **one RX queue**, but up to **8 queues** are supported for traffic classification.

### **3. Data Link Layer (L2 Processing)**
- The **L2 module** checks the packet for correctness.
- If needed, it **removes L2 headers** (e.g., MAC headers, frame check sequences).

### **4. Network Layer (IP Verification - L3 Processing)**
- If the packet is **IP-based**, the **L3 layer** verifies whether it is a **valid IPv4 or IPv6 packet**.

### **5. Transport Layer (Finding the Correct Socket)**
- A **socket handler** identifies which active socket the packet belongs to.
- The packet is placed into the appropriate **socket queue**.

### **6. Application Layer (Delivering Data to User)**
- The application retrieves the data via **BSD socket API (`recv()`, `recvfrom()`)**.
- The application processes the data as needed.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
 - **TX (Transmit) Process** involves **data encapsulation**, queuing (`k_fifo`), and transmission via device drivers.
 - **RX (Receive) Process** includes **data extraction**, queuing, and socket-based delivery.
 - **Layered Architecture** ensures efficient, priority-based networking in Zephyr.
 - **Traffic Classification** supports up to **8 TX/RX queues** for managing different packet priorities.

This structured approach ensures reliable and efficient data communication in embedded networking systems.

## **Here are the key terms used in Zephyr’s RX (receive) and TX (transmit) processes:**

### 1.  **Device Driver**
A network device driver is responsible for interacting with the physical network hardware (NIC, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, etc.). It handles:

Receiving packets and passing them to the RX queue.
Sending packets provided by the TX queue to the network.
Managing network buffers (net_buf) to store packets.
### 2. **RX (Receive) Queues and TX (Transmit) Queues (k_fifo)**
Zephyr uses FIFO (First In, First Out) queues to handle packets at different priorities.

RX queues store incoming packets and separate interrupt processing from regular processing.
TX queues classify outgoing packets based on priority before transmission.
By default, there is one queue, but up to 8 queues can be configured for handling different priorities (e.g., VoIP traffic vs. background downloads).

### 3. **L2 (Layer 2) Module**
L2 modules handle data link layer communication and ensure frames are properly formatted.

Functions of L2 Module:
Strips L2 headers (like Ethernet headers).
Verifies Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for error detection.
Adds L2 headers when sending data.
Examples:
Ethernet (802.3)
Wi-Fi (802.11)
Bluetooth (802.15.4 for IoT)
### 4. **L3 (Layer 3) Module**
The L3 module manages network layer processing, which includes:

Checking whether the packet is IPv4 or IPv6.
Routing the packet to the correct destination.
Handling fragmentation if a packet is too large.
Managing network statistics (enabled via CONFIG_NET_STATISTICS).
### 5. **BSD Socket API**
The Berkeley Sockets (BSD Sockets) API provides a standard way for applications to send and receive data.

Applications use it to create and manage network connections.
When an application sends data, the BSD API:
Wraps the data in protocol headers (e.g., UDP, TCP).
Passes it to the network stack for transmission.
Places it in a TX queue for the device driver to send.
For receiving data, the API:

Retrieves packets from the RX queue.
Matches the packet to the correct socket.
Delivers data to the application.
### 6. **net_buf Structures**
Zephyr uses network buffer (net_buf) structures to store packets as they are processed.

When a packet is received, a net_buf is allocated and filled with data.
When sending, data is copied into net_buf before adding headers.
This improves memory efficiency and reduces packet loss.

### 7. **Traffic Classification**
Zephyr supports Traffic Classification, meaning different packets are handled with different priorities.

Example: A video call packet (high priority) is sent before a background file download (low priority).
Handled via multiple RX/TX queues (up to 8).
### 8. **Userspace vs. Kernel Space**
Kernel Space: Where the network stack runs (higher privileges, faster execution).
Userspace: Where the application runs (lower privileges, isolated from hardware).
Why separation? Prevents applications from directly accessing hardware, improving security and stability.
### 9. **Network Interface**
The Network Interface (NIC) is the software representation of a network adapter.
It ensures the device is properly configured before allowing packets to be sent.
